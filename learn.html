Facilities can range in size from huge dams built over wide rivers to small generators taking advantage of irrigation ditches. Some hydropower systems generate electricity without the use of a dam, instead channeling a portion of a stream through a powerhouse before allowing it to rejoin the main river. Hydropower relies on relatively stable rainfall and will be affected if water levels change - so it is more practical in some locations than in others.

                    <h1>Costs and Benefits</h1>
                    <p>Changing infrastructure is never cheap or easy, and energy is no exception. Clean energy systems usually have a high initial cost, which turns many homeowners away. The cost is multiplied when a whole community is being considered, rather than a single building. It often seems simpler to keep the existing nonrenewable energy infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>However, when considering the costs associated with renewable energy, it’s important to also consider the benefits. Over time, many clean energy systems will provide a high return on investment. This means that the money they save on ongoing energy costs adds up to (and then exceeds) the money they could have saved by using a nonrenewable energy source. So, although renewable energy may seem expensive at first, over time, it becomes cheaper than the alternatives.</p>
                    <p class="space-bottom">There are also many government-funded resources and programs that reward the use of clean energy, often in tax credits, but occasionally in loans or grants. These can help offset the cost of installing renewable energy systems, and are a win-win for you and for the environment.</p>

                    <h1>Renewable Energy and the Environment</h1>
                    <p>Emissions from nonrenewable energy sources such as coal have contributed to significant climate change - 2023 was the warmest year we have ever recorded.<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2023-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record-by-far" target="_blank" class="source-link"><sup><i class="fa fa-solid fa-link"></i></sup></a> Current carbon dioxide levels are comparable to 4.1 million years ago, when sea levels were high enough to put most of the world’s major cities underwater, and the Arctic tundra was a forest. By 2050 (jin ust over 25 years), many major consequences of climate change will be irreversible, including the loss of the Amazon rainforest and major ocean systems.</p>
                    <p class="space-bottom">We can significantly reduce our impact on the planet by switching to clean energy. Generating renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric, does not release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - but nonrenewable energy production in the U.S. releases 1.65 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year. Additionally, green energy typically results in less air and water pollution than combustible fuels, and often has a smaller physical footprint (size) than nonrenewable energy.</p>

                    <p>Changing infrastructure is never cheap or easy, and energy is no exception. Clean energy systems usually have a high initial cost, which turns many homeowners away. The cost is multiplied when a whole community is being considered, rather than a single building. It often seems simpler to keep the existing nonrenewable energy infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>However, when considering the costs associated with renewable energy, it’s important to also consider the benefits. Over time, many clean energy systems will provide a high return on investment. This means that the money they save on ongoing energy costs adds up to (and then exceeds) the money they could have saved by using a nonrenewable energy source. So, although renewable energy may seem expensive at first, over time, it becomes cheaper than the alternatives.</p>
                    <p class="space-bottom">There are also many government-funded resources and programs that reward the use of clean energy, often in tax credits, but occasionally in loans or grants. These can help offset the cost of installing renewable energy systems, and are a win-win for you and for the environment.</p>

                    <h1>Renewable Energy and the Environment</h1>
                    <p>Emissions from nonrenewable energy sources such as coal have contributed to significant climate change - 2023 was the warmest year we have ever recorded.<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2023-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record-by-far" target="_blank" class="source-link"><sup><i class="fa fa-solid fa-link"></i></sup></a> Current carbon dioxide levels are comparable to 4.1 million years ago, when sea levels were high enough to put most of the world’s major cities underwater, and the Arctic tundra was a forest. By 2050 (jin ust over 25 years), many major consequences of climate change will be irreversible, including the loss of the Amazon rainforest and major ocean systems.</p>
                    <p class="space-bottom">We can significantly reduce our impact on the planet by switching to clean energy. Generating renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric, does not release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - but nonrenewable energy production in the U.S. releases 1.65 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year. Additionally, green energy typically results in less air and water pollution than combustible fuels, and often has a smaller physical footprint (size) than nonrenewable energy.</p>
